\chapter{Cryptographic Hashes and MACs}

\section{Hash function}
A hash function takes in an arbitrary length message and outputs a fixed length n-bit hash: $\{0, 1\}^* \rightarrow \{0, 1\}^n$. It is deterministic and efficient.

\medskip
 
 \emph{Intuition}: A hash function provides a fixed-length fingerprint over a sequence of bits.
 
\section{Properties of hash functions}
 We want hash functions to have the following properties to ensure security:
 \begin{itemize}
     \item One-way/preimage resistant: We cannot feasibly (i.e. compute in polynomial time) map an output back to its input.
     \item Collision resistant: It is infeasible to find any collisions. Note that it is impossible to avoid collisions.
     \item Random: There is no predictable patterns for determining how input affects output.
 \end{itemize}
